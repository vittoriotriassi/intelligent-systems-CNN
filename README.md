# Intelligent Systems - CNN

In the following repository I'm going to share a report I have been working on for the **Intelligent Systems** course that I took in the first semester of my Master's Degree at University of Milan.

## Survey Project on Convolutional Neural Networks
### Abstract

The aim of the following report is to debate about the technology of *Convolutional Neural Networks* by collecting a number of papers published from 2015 until 2019 on the most famous digital libraries. Ten papers are presented and organized into chapters which contain different approaches to improve the performance of such models. Each paper is discussed and divided into two sections. The first one deals with the proposed method, while the second one covers experimental results and achievements.
